The turning of the key in the lock makes your skin crawl. However, as you look around the room, you slowly start to relax. Other than the fact that the furnishings are obviously quite old, the room appears quite normal. There is a window in the middle of the wall to your front, no doubt affording a breath-taking view of the estate. To the left of the window is an ornate writing desk that must be at least two hundred years old. To the right of the window, on a richly inlaid table, is a gramophone, looking as if it was bought only yesterday.The wall to your right is completely taken up with an immense bookcase built around an Italian marble fireplace. The shelves are packed tight with books, and from your viewpoint, most of them seem to be bound in leather. There are logs in the fireplace, but no fire. Of course, considering the summer heat, a fire would be out of the question, but somehow you kind of wish there was, as if the cheery glow from it would ward away all things evil.In the center of the left wall is the bed, a massive four-poster with canopy. To its right, a nightstand. A rather time-worn rocking chair is to the left. Behind you is the door, and to its right, an old-fashioned washstand, with pitcher, bowl, and a rather oddly shaped mirror on the wall behind. All in all, a normal-looking room.
