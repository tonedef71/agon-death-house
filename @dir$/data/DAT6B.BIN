Suddenly you find yourself standing back by the bed. Astonished, you feel a great sense of relief wash over you.
It must have all been a dream. You're alive - you've survived, and soon you'll be a millionaire! Your reverie gets cut short when you see a ghastly creature walk out of the wall in front of you!

You notice that they no longer seem to eye you malevolently, but appear to be... just waiting.Now the full horror of it all dawns on you. You HAVE DIED; you're just like them, and like them, for all eternity, you'll keep watch here, waiting for another fool to enter...
