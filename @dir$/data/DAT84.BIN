This fireplace is huge! It looks like you could park a VW bug in it. The marble has been meticulously scrubbed. Not one trace of soot remains. The logs give off a tantalizing pine odor.
Conspicuous by its absence is the screen. For such a large fireplace, it seems rather dangerous to leave the front opened up.
