You hear, off in the distance, a door being opened, followed by furtive footsteps. With the strength only a dying man could muster, you manage to open your eyes. The old man is now standing over you, sadly shaking his head. You try to speak, but can only gasp in pain. Slowly, the vision of the old man dims, and with a final heavy sigh, you pass from this world.
