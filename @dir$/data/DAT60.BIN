It's now 1 AM!!!
The door to the room suddenly flies open, and in walks the old man. He's apparently startled to see you (still) standing there. With a nod of his head, he motions you to follow him. You do so, out of the room, down the stairs, and back to the parlor, where you first started tonight.Well, :NM:, sit down!!
Good show, good show! I'm glad someone has finally survived. Looks like you've broken the curse of that damned room. I've got your check right here. Don't worry, it's certified, all on the up and up.
