Welcome to my house, :NM:. Well, let's see. Oh, it's only half past eleven. That gives me a few minutes to explain the situation to you. Are you quite comfortable in that chair?
Good, then why don't I begin.
The proposition is actually quite a simple one. At midnight, I lock you in the east bedroom of this house. At precisely 1 AM, I will unlock the door. If you are still alive, I will give you, free and clear, the sum of $1,000,000.I know that must sound terribly insane, but I trust you did enough research to understand the offer.
You did do some checking around, didn't you?
Well, no matter; I can tell you about it.The room you are about to enter was once my great-grandfather's. Some time after midnight one dreary night, the servants heard a terrible scream coming from his bed chamber. When they opened the door to his room, he was dead. The doctor said that he had died of a heart attack. The servants swore he looked as if he was scared into his grave. Ever since his death, anyone who slept in his room died, some time between midnight and one AM. When I took possession of this house, I made the offer I now propose to you. Four people took me up on it. All died. So that's the story, pure and simple.
...
My, is it that time already? Well, why don't you follow me up these stairs......
Ah, here we are. I see you have your flashlight. Good, you never know around here when the lights will go out.
Well, it's that time, :NM:......
Take care, and I hope to find you fine and well in an hour.
Good luck!!!
