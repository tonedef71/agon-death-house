This is quite a fine piece of furniture. The desk is made out of solid teak, with brass trimmings. An ink well is set into the right side, an old quill pen next to it. Other than a note next to the pen, the desktop is empty, except for an antique clock. There are two drawers in the desk, both partially opened.
