Death House: a port to [BBC BASIC v3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_BASIC) of the horror [interactive fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction) [game coded for the Commodore 64 by Mark S. Boucher](https://archive.org/details/Death_House_19xx_Mark_S._Boucher).
* The game features a telegram-like text delivery style, and the interactive fiction game mechanic mostly resembles that of a ["Choose Your Adventure"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure) novel.
* Death House may be played on an [AgonLight retro-computer](https://www.olimex.com/Products/Retro-Computers/AgonLight2/open-source-hardware), the [AgonLight Emulator](https://github.com/astralaster/agon-light-emulator/releases), or the [BBC BASIC SDL](http://www.bbcbasic.co.uk/bbcsdl/).
* Due to its large program size, Death House is currently only capable of running within BBC BASIC SDL or within the [Agon BBC BASIC ADL interpreter for AgonLight](https://github.com/breakintoprogram/agon-bbc-basic-adl).

## HOW TO PLAY

The object of Death House is to stay alive for a full hour while locked in the cursed east bedroom of a stately home.  The odds are stacked against you, but with a little luck, you can forestall the curse just long enough to collect a cool million dollars from the elderly eccentric owner of the home.

## Display
Death House has been coded to play on a mode that supports a minimum of 16 colors and minimum screen dimensions of 40 columns by 22 rows.

On BBC BASIC SDL, MODE 9 is supported, and on the Agon Light, MODE 2 is supported.
